    "**Ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll learn about another ensemble method called **gradient boosting**. It goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we start the cycle:\n",
    "- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.\n",
    "- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like mean squared error, for instance).\n",
    "- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use gradient descent on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)\n",

    "## Parameter Tuning\n",
    "XGBoost has a few parameters that can dramatically affect accuracy and training speed. The first parameters you should understand are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### n_estimators\n",
    "**n_estimators** specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above. It is equal to the number of models that we include in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too low a value causes underfitting, which leads to inaccurate predictions on both training data and test data.\n",
    "Too high a value causes overfitting, which causes accurate predictions on training data, but inaccurate predictions on test data (which is what we care about).\n",
    "Typical values range from 100-1000, though this depends a lot on the learning_rate parameter discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### early_stopping_rounds\n",
    "**early_stopping_rounds** offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for n_estimators. It's smart to set a high value for n_estimators and then use early_stopping_rounds to find the optimal time to stop iterating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping. Setting early_stopping_rounds=5 is a reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using early_stopping_rounds, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the **eval_set** parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you later want to fit a model with all of your data, set n_estimators to whatever value you found to be optimal when run with early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### learning_rate\n",
    "Instead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the **learning rate**) before adding them in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less. So, we can set a higher value for n_estimators without overfitting. If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle. As default, XGBoost sets learning_rate=0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### n_jobs\n",
    "On larger datasets where runtime is a consideration, you can use parallelism to build your models faster. It's common to set the parameter **n_jobs** equal to the number of cores on your machine. On smaller datasets, this won't help.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting model won't be any better, so micro-optimizing for fitting time is typically nothing but a distraction. But, it's useful in large datasets where you would otherwise spend a long time waiting during the fit command.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "XGBoost is a the leading software library for working with standard tabular data (the type of data you store in Pandas DataFrames, as opposed to more exotic types of data like images and videos). With careful parameter tuning, you can train highly accurate models."

    "This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of leakage: **target leakage** and **train-test contamination**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Leakage\n",
    "Target leakage occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example will be helpful. Imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "|got_pneumonia | age   | weight\t| male  |took_antibiotic_medicine |\n",
    "|--------------|-------|--------|-------|-------------------------|\n",
    "|False         | 65    | 100    | False | False                   |\n",
    "|False\t       | 72\t   | 130    | True  | False                   |\n",
    "|True\t       | 58\t   | 100    | False | True                    |\n",
    "\n",
    "People take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. The raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns, but took_antibiotic_medicine is frequently changed after the value for got_pneumonia is determined. This is target leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would see that anyone who has a value of False for took_antibiotic_medicine didn't have pneumonia. Since validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Train-Test Contamination\n",
    "\n",
    "A different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split(). The end result? Your model may get good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all, you incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when you do more complex feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if you use scikit-learn pipelines. When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Data leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation. Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage.\n",
